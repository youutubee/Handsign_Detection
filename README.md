    <h1>Handsign Detection</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Handsign Detection project repository! This project aims to facilitate real-time detection of hand signs, particularly those from the American Sign Language (ASL), using machine learning and computer vision techniques. Through the integration of various libraries such as MediaPipe, scikit-learn, and OpenCV, this model enables users to interact with applications and devices using intuitive hand gestures.</p>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Real-time Detection</strong>: Our model offers instantaneous detection of ASL hand signs, providing seamless interaction for users.</li>
        <li><strong>Very High Accuracy</strong>: The model boasts very high accuracy due to comprehensive training on a wide range of datasets.</li>
        <li><strong>Comprehensive Training</strong>: Trained using MediaPipe for hand tracking, scikit-learn for machine learning with a Random Forest classifier, and OpenCV for image processing, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.</li>
        <li><strong>Wide Range of Dataset</strong>: The model has been trained on a diverse dataset, enhancing its ability to recognize various hand signs accurately.</li>
        <li><strong>User-friendly Interface</strong>: Extensive documentation and examples are provided for easy integration and usage of the hand sign detection system.</li>
        <li><strong>Customization Options</strong>: Users can customize the model to detect additional ASL hand signs or words, catering to specific communication needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Meaningful Sentences</strong>: In addition to individual hand signs, the model recognizes select words, enabling users to construct meaningful sentences for enhanced communication.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This model supports only the detection of the right hand, as the dataset used for training is specific to right-hand gestures.</p>
