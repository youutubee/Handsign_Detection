# Handsing_Detection
Welcome to the Handsing_Detection repository! This project focuses on developing a real-time hand sign detection system using machine learning techniques and computer vision libraries in Python. Leveraging the power of MediaPipe, scikit-learn, and OpenCV, this model enables the detection of user hand signs in live video streams.
